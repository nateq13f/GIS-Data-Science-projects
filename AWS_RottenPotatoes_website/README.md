# AWS website for my senior design class

I was the backend manager and hosted the website on AWS.

The final architecture was a simple ec2 with RDS.
We did not go with the HA design because we wanted to stay within the free-tier costs.
We also did not go with the serverless design becasue the front end team would have had to redesign the code to integrate with the API gateway.
